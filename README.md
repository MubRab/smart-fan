# smart-fan
Smart fan system with the PIC18F45K22

The smart fan will be have two modes, namely manual- and automatic mode. The manual mode will allow the user to control the fan manually, such as adjusting speed and the direction of the fan. While, the automatic mode will use temperature sensors to adjust the speed of the fan automatically, depending on the ambient temperature. The system will also use light sensors to switch on lights, near the fan user interface, whenever there is a drop in light intensity of the environment. The system uses ultrasonic sensors to detect any obstacles near the fan, for safety purposes.

## Components interfaced with the PIC18:
- Thermistors
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- LDR
- I2C LCD
- Stepper Motor
- DC Motor
